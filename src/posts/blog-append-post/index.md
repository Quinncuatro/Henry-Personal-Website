I haven't been updating this nearly as much as I should have been. Truth be told I've been ignoring some of my yearly goals. Guitar has all but fallen to the wayside, and I'm honestly okay with that. It's one of those things I'd love to be good at, but really don't want to put the effort into.

Rock climbing has been in a bit of a lull, but I've been backpacking when I can, and the weather is finally getting right to start climbing outside. I'm planning on spending this weekend at Seven Falls State Park to get some bouldering in. Really psyched for that.

I've been using all the extra free time to really focus on web development. I realized that with the skills I had, I really wasn't going to get anywhere fun very fast. After looking around at different code camps, I finally stumbled onto [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/). The way they lay out their lessons makes a lot more sense to me than anything else I've found so far. It takes a lot of time and effort, but by the time you're done, you earn Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization certifications. They even have you work with a small team to build functional websites for two non profits. At the end, you have a lot more experience, a solid portfolio, and usually some job offers.

I've been cranking away on it, and at about 202.33 hours in, I have some pretty cool stuff to show for it:

- [Paul Rudd Tribute Page](http://crashthebot.net/freecodecamp/tribute)
- [Random Quote Generator](http://crashthebot.net/freecodecamp/quotes)
- [Weather Checker](http://crashthebot.net/freecodecamp/weather)
- [Wikipedia Portal](http://crashthebot.net/freecodecamp/wiki)
- [Personal Webpage](http://crashthebot.net/)

Granted, some of those aren't looking the best they could on mobile, but these early stages are more about learning different JavaScript frameworks than responsive web design. It's a lot of fun, and it's actually helping a lot for my current job, so win/win.
