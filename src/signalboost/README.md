# Signal Boost Instructions
---

Hey there! If you're looking for a new gig I'd love to help out by putting some information about you on my signal boosts page.

Just clone this repository, add our information to [this page](https://github.com/Quinncuatro/Henry-Personal-Website/src/signalboost/signalboost.yaml), and put in a pull request.

```markdown
people:
  - name: "John Doe"
    tech: "bash docker devops gatsby javascript kubernetes linux sql web"
    github: "https://github.com/username"
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/username"
```

Add your info as a new object under `people`. Here's an example:

```markdown
people:
  - name: "John Doe"
    tech: "bash docker devops gatsby javascript kubernetes linux sql web"
    github: "https://github.com/johndoe"
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/johndoe"
  - name: "Jane Doe"
    tech: "angular javascript openshift python golang pandas postgresql"
    github: "https://github.com/janedoe"
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/janedoe"
```

Once I get the notification of your PR, check your formatting, and roll your change into my main branch a Netlify build should kick off and deploy the updated version.

Please feel free to [hit me up](https://henryneeds.coffee/contact) if there's anything else I might be able to do to help you land a new job!

And please remember to take yourself off this page when you find the next thing. I look forward to reviewing a celebratory PR with you!
