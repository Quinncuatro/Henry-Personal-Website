So I've been wanting to start a digital garden for a _while_.

I've read articles from [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), [Amy Hoy](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/), [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up), and several others about how they've set up their digital gardens and how the easily accessible short-form notes are helpful in their everyday lives. Suffice to say, I've been sold on the idea for a while.

However, it took seeing [Kyle Shook's new digital garden](https://www.kyle.garden/) the other day for me to finally take some action on it.

So, I finally started my own. This going to be a place somewhere between a notebook and blog where I can flesh out ideas in public. Some might turn into blog posts in the future, but most probably won't.

In any case, I'm sure having a public place I can point to some note or other will be helpful to both myself and any others I might help with learning a concept I've already wrestled with.
