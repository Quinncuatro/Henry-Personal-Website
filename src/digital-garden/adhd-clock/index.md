So lately I've learned that I exhibit a lot of symptoms of adult ADHD.

As I'm learning more about it, and trying to find ways to get my brain to work with me, I've found that schedules are super helpful.

I miss being in an office with set meeting times. Stuff like transition times, breaking up the morning and afternoon with commutes. Walking to lunch.

So I'm building a clock to have those kind of chimes you get from a high school bell at home.

Starting to get back into electronics. My elegoo kit.

Combination of Arduino, RFID module, 7-segment display, and a speaker.

Pictures of the hardware, share some of the code.
