Welcome to the repo for my personal website. It's build on top of a GatsbyJS hello-world template (with some stuff obviously wrenched on).

Please feel free to use anything here for motivation or help when building your own site!

All I ask is that you credit me somewhere - even if it's in the source!

Clone this repo, navigate into your it's directory, and start it up.

  ```shell
  $ cd Henry-Personal-Website/
  $ gatsby develop
  ```

The site should be running at`http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: There's also a second link: http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql`._

> This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying data (here, provided mainly by `./src/resume/resume.yaml`). Learn more about using this tool in [this Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `Henry-Personal-Site` directory in your code editor of choice and explore the code! Make some edits to `.js` files. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
