          <p>- Transitioned the Judicial Dashboard to work on an on-premise OpenShift/GlusterFS solution, cutting the deployment time down by 99.17%. This involved converting a single server buildout to a Docker solution to allow multiple developers to work concurrently on their local machines followed by another conversion to Kubernetes to facilitate an efficient rollout to 34 courts in the next six months.
            <br> - Created, maintained, and provided enhancements to the codebase for a web application that automates the daily "getting up to speed" work for District Judges across the country, saving roughly an hour’s worth of time per judge every morning.
            <br> - Collaborated with a remote team of engineers in D.C. to test the scalability of OpenShift for use by other judiciary development teams. This platform is now in the process of being elevated to being a national resource.
            <br> - Communicated with the national IT Security Office to scan images and engineer solutions to remediate findings.
            held partially in the Hartford courtrooms.
            <br> - Interfaced with District Judges and users in the pilot courts testing the Judicial Dashboard to better understand user needs.
            <br> - Coordinated with cross-functional stakeholders in the AO to align all teams in a common strategic direction.</p>

          <p>- Transitioned in-house legacy applications to container based architectures with Docker for easier development and deployment. The ability to develop more quickly lead to a partnership with the Case Management Solutions Office in D.C., the hiring of part time developers, and a speedier rollout of the Judicial Dashboard product.
            <br> - Experimented with modern web technologies like Vue.js, Node, and Webpack to lay the groundwork of modernizing the tech stack of the Judicial Dashboard project in order to better source talent for a nationwide rollout.
            <br> - Communicated with developers across the judiciary about emerging technologies that could overhaul the core applications used by districts across the country. That combined advocacy led to a container focused overhaul of the organization's core product offerings and a judiciary-wide OpenShift hosting environment that the District of Connecticut is currently piloting.
            <br> - Implemented an iPad fleet and MachForm solution to shorten the process of gathering information from potential jurors, normalizing the data, and getting it into the hands of attorneys in high profile cases, by 92.5%.
            <br> - Developed a touchscreen jury sign in kiosk to undercut the cost of Xerox’s proposed product, to be used in courthouses nationwide, by ~85%.
            <br> - Coordinated with the district's Security Officer to keep various web servers patched and secure.</p>
