After having some discussions with folks on the (/r/sleepingoptiplex)[https://reddit.com/r/sleepingoptiplex] subreddit, I wanted to toss up a first post on what I'm doing with my OptiPlex 390 build.



## It's the spring of 2011. I've already been accepted to college. Senioritis is setting in and 3OH!3 is blaring on my headphones as I sit at my desk at 2 AM on a school night...

I'm working on a project built on IPFS with a buddy of mine from GitLab.

Without giving too much away: it's built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), hosted on IPFS with [Fleek](https://fleek.co/), and should help folks adapt to the early days of this new web protocol.

I should another blog post with some more information to share soon.

Stay frosty.
