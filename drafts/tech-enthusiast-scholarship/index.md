Since getting into computers in middle school, I’ve had a lot of people supporting my self learning. My parents, some teachers, high school IT staff, and different community members were behind me learning how to traverse networks, write basic scripts, and build my first couple of websites.

Sorry if I CC’d too many people, but I think I got the correct teams!

My name’s Henry Quinn and I took a number of different classes with Mr. Angelo and Ms. (Mrs.?) Dean back when I attended EHHS. Of all the teachers I had, they’re really the ones who pushed me to pursue some form of computer science as a career even when there weren’t any classes related to software development.

I actually graduated from Champlain College four years ago with a degree in Computer Network & Information Security with a specialization in Cyber Security. I worked for the United States District Courts for a few years managing some of their systems, building custom web applications, and automating process workflows for different departments. That all led up to landing a new gig with Clarity Software Solutions as a DevOps Engineer a little over a month ago.

It’s been a wild ride, and I’m not sure if I would have gotten where I am without Mr. Angelo and Ms. Dean pushing me to pick up independent studies in high school. Those electives really prompted me to learn how to find resources to teach myself and fill the gap between courses offered by the school and what I actually wanted to learn.

I actually received a couple of scholarships (that I believe were due to Mr. Angelo’s nomination) that helped cover the cost of college textbooks.

To that end, I’d like to pay it forward and set up a small scholarship to help EHHS students that are interested in pursuing some kind of technical training post high school purchase textbooks or training materials. From what I hear there still aren’t many, if any, software development electives on offer so I want to do what I can to let the more computer-minded students know that there are people in their corner who want to help them succeed in a more technical career.

I’m not entirely sure what’s involved with setting that up and am assuming there is some planning and paperwork to fill out. If anyone would like to get back to me with next steps I’d love to work towards getting this set up for the class of 2020. 

And again, I just want to say thank you to Mr. Angelo and Ms. Dean for pushing me all through high school to keep learning beyond the required curriculum. I might have eventually ended up where I am in my career, but the road would have been a lot rockier without you two.

Henry
It was fantastic getting this email! When I write recommendations I use a scale where you are the top and I judge from there. I am also pleased that life has turned out so good, and most of all you are doing what you like, that is not a job but a lifestyle. I would suggest you also reach out to the current principal, Frank Rizzuto. I am officially retired as of last Thursday but will do anything I can to get you to your goal.  Maybe this will be my continued connection with EHHS.
Keep me in the loop
Jim
